Beachy Tic Tac Toe

The Backstory:

This was my first completed project during my course at GA. In my game, I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, and some jQuery. The first steps in this project were to create the code for the HTML and work from there. I created the authorization for the users first and made sure that the buttons worked and then worked on the actual board and how to track player moves. After many trial and error, I used help from developer friends as well as my instructors to debug and work on taking things in a step by step method. I'm glad to say I have a fully functioning game!

Unsolved Problems:
UI designs - I wasn't able to create images for the board like I originally wanted to do.
Making the computer play against the user would be another function I would've liked to have added
